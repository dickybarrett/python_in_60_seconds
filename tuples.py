#tuples are immutable cant be changed
#you cant reassign an element in a tuple
#tuples use parenthesis (1,2,3)

mylist = [1,2,3] #uses brackets
mydictionary = {'key1':1,'key2':2} #uses swirls
mytuple = (1,2,3,'bob')

print(len(mytuple))
print(mytuple[0]) #can be indexed
print(mytuple.count('bob'))
print(mytuple.index(2))

#because tuples are immutable they are good for passing around objects and protecting them
